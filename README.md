# Imputor
IMPUTOR is a software program written in the Python language for the purpose of identifying miscalled bases in sequence or variant data. Advances in next-generation sequencing have provided researchers with a wealth of data, but the data generated has proven variable in its fidelity to the original sequence. Numerous software pipelines have been constructed in order to process data, with one important step being the assessment and correction of chemical or mechanical errors introduced by the NGS process. In some cases, these methods have used reference sequences derived from sequencing methods with greater coverage or reliability, while some have also implemented methods to impute missing data via the principle of parsimony. IMPUTOR imputes missing or suspected mis-called bases via parsimony, identifying sites where a combination of mechanical error and conservative base calls may have misidentified the site.
